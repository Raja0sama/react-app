# React Native App

A brief description of your project, including the fact that it is built with React Native, uses React Navigation and Redux Toolkit

## Update about react-native-web
React Native Web is a project that allows you to use React Native components and APIs to build web applications using React. However, using React Native Web is not a best idea for several reasons. First, most of the libraries that work with React Native do not support React Native Web, which means you will have to find alternatives or write your own code to make them work. Second, React Native Web requires a lot of mocks and configuration to set it up, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Third, React Native Web does not have the same performance and compatibility as native web development, which can affect your user experience and SEO. Therefore, unless you have a very specific use case for React Native Web, you should consider other options for web development.

I personally spent last 2 days trying to come up with a best solution to get this to work with react native and regardless of how many mocks you make and configration you do, you will end up facing problems. I am planning on finishing this web config, but i am out of time so sending you as it is. 

Also becasue of lack of time, i might have missed some requirements. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you can set up the project, you will need to have the following software installed on your local machine:

- React Native
- Android Studio (if you want to run the project on Android)
- Xcode (if you want to run the project on iOS)

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the root directory of the project and install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Depending on your desired platform, run either `npx react-native run-android` or npx `react-native run-ios` to start the development server and launch the app on your emulator or device.

## FAQ's

#### What libraries have i used?

React Navigation, Redux-tool kit, React redux, nativebase, webview, and Nativewind.

#### Why i used native wind?

Because it helps to write quick and effective and efficient code and can easily be migrated to any web browser based applications as well. NAtive wind is Tailwind for React native and work flawlessly and is a universal style system. Can read more from here [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)
